# ISO 14971 Risk Management
This repository contains content relevant to the application for ISO 14971.  I'm sick of having to re-write this from scratch repeatedly.

## Documentation
*Italicized content* in the documents is contextual information and should be removed as appropriate.

Use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to generate documentation from the markdown files.  For example
```
pandoc .\docs\risk-management-plan.md -o risk-management-plan.pdf --template=document-template.tex
```
Will convert the risk management plan to a pdf using the template found in this repo.

## Risk Management Plan
This is a template for a risk management plan that complies with the requirements of ISO 14971: 2019.
